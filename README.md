# Abstract
Tropomyosins coat actin filaments to impact actin-related signaling and cell morphogenesis. Genome-wide association studies have linked Tropomyosin 1 (TPM1) with human blood trait variation. Prior work suggested that TPM1 regulated blood cell formation in vitro, but it was unclear how or when TPM1 affected hematopoiesis. Using gene-edited induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) model systems, we found that TPM1 knockout augmented developmental cell state transitions and key signaling pathways to promote hemogenic endothelial (HE) cell specification and hematopoietic progenitor cell (HPC) production. Single-cell analyses revealed decreased TPM1 expression during human HE specification, suggesting that TPM1 regulated in vivo hematopoiesis via similar mechanisms. Indeed, analyses of a TPM1 gene trap mouse model showed that TPM1 deficiency enhanced the formation of HE during embryogenesis. These findings illuminate novel effects of TPM1 on developmental hematopoiesis.
